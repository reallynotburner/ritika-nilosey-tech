We are interviewing someone with an impressive resume and penchant for quality automation, testing, and performance enhancement via Selenium and CI/CD. But, can they pull through when...

## Disaster!
Our app is supposed to give the user a Nasa Picture of the Day when it loads.  But, it's taking WAY too long to display the picture to the user!  Lag has struck down our formerly delightful user interaction and threatens to bring our reputation into the dirt.  

## Deliverable
Figure out by any means necessary what's going wrong in our app!  You're our only hope!

## Caveat
Josh has accidentally erased the .git folder and all distributed copies of the app have been discarded.  Version Control is not able to save us now.  We must rely on our wits alone!

## Installation
```bash
npm install
```
## To run app
```bash
npm run dev
```
then open http://localhost:5173/ on your favorite browser.  Open this folder in your favorite IDE and edit any file and save, results immediately show up on your browser.  Try `src/App.tsx` as a start.

## To Deploy
```bash
npm run build
```
then you have a static export in the `dist` folder, minified and uglified for absolute minimum code size.
